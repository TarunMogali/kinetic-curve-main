# **App Name**: Kinetic Curve

## Core Features:

- Bézier Curve Generation: Generate a cubic Bézier curve based on four control points, calculating points along the curve for rendering.
- Dynamic Control Points: Animate P1 and P2 control points by linking them to gyroscope data (iOS) or mouse movement (Web) input, with spring-damping for smooth motion.
- Tangent Vector Computation: Calculate and display tangent vectors along the curve to visualize direction at different points.
- Interactive Rendering: Render the Bézier curve, control points, and tangent lines, updating in real-time with user input.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of sophistication and mathematical precision.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant magenta (#FF00FF) to highlight control points and tangent lines, providing visual contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for both body and headline, offering a modern and neutral appearance that ensures readability and a machined feel.
- Simple, geometric icons for control points and any interactive elements, keeping with the minimalist design.
- Clean and uncluttered layout with clear visual hierarchy, emphasizing the dynamic curve and its interactive elements.
- Smooth, physics-based animations for control point movements, providing a natural and responsive feel.
